  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    Example, Inc. wants to understand how often users of its web site are
    running into browser interventions, in order to better devote its developer
    resources to improving site performance. It can do this by delivering the
    following header to define a default reporting endpoint, which will direct
    intervention reports there:

    <pre>
      Reporting-Endpoints: default="https://example.com/reports"
    </pre>

  Interventions are discussed in https://github.com/WICG/interventions.

  <h2 id="intervention-report">Intervention Reports</h3>

  <dfn>Intervention reports</dfn> indicate that a user agent has decided not to
  honor a request made by the application (e.g. for security, performance or
  user annoyance reasons).

  <a>Intervention reports</a> are a type of [=report=].

  <a>Intervention reports</a> have the <a>report type</a> "intervention".

  <a>Intervention reports</a> are <a>visible to
  <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
    interface InterventionReportBody : ReportBody {
      [Default] object toJSON();
      readonly attribute DOMString id;
      readonly attribute DOMString message;
      readonly attribute DOMString? sourceFile;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? lineNumber;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? columnNumber;
    };
  </pre>

  An <a>intervention report</a>'s [=report/body=], represented in JavaScript by
  {{InterventionReportBody}}, contains the following fields:

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">id</dfn>: an implementation-defined
      string identifying the specific intervention that occurred. This string
      can be used for grouping and counting related reports.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">message</dfn>: A human-readable string
      with details typically matching what would be displayed on the developer
      console. The message is not guaranteed to be unique for a given
      [=InterventionReportBody/id=] (e.g. it may contain additional context on
      what led to the intervention).

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">sourceFile</dfn>: If known, the file
      which first used the indicated API, or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">lineNumber</dfn>: If known, the line
      number in [=InterventionReportBody/sourceFile=] of the offending behavior
      (which prompted the intervention), or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">columnNumber</dfn>: If known, the
      column number in [=InterventionReportBody/sourceFile=] of the offending
      behavior (which prompted the intervention), or null otherwise.


  Note: Intervention reports are always delivered to the <a>endpoint</a> named
  <code>default</code>; there is currently no way to override this.  If you want
  to receive other kinds of reports, but not intervention reports, make sure to
  use a different name for the endpoint that you choose for those reports.
